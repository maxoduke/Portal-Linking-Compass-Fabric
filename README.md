# Portal Linking Compass

---

## Description:

Introduces a compass that displays precise coordinates for constructing a corresponding portal in the other dimension to link them up perfectly.

The mod must be installed on both client and server to be able to function properly.  
Available on Fabric, Quilt and Forge:
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/portal-linking-compass)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/portal-linking-compass)


## Why this mod was created:

The mod was originally created because I wanted to try and play the game without coordinates (reducedDebugInfo  gamerule set to true).

Almost everything in-game can be done without coordinates. Maps, compasses and lodestones (albeit a little expensive) are great tools for locating places.

However, a few things aren't possible without coordinates. Such as:
- Linking nether portals
- Finding the coordinates to manipulate and generate an end gateway in the middle of the void.
- A bunch more things I haven't thought of.

This mod tackles at least the first problem and allows players to build proper nether hubs.
I thought I may as well publish the mod for other people like me.


## How to install:
- If you're on Fabric, make sure you have [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) installed.
- If you're on Quilt, make sure you have [QFAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) installed.
- Download JAR and put in your mods folder.


## How to use:

### Step 1:
Craft a Portal Linking Compass using a crafting table.  
The recipe is unlocked after picking up a compass, and will become visible in the recipe book.  
It requires:
- 3 obsidian
- 1 compass
- 1 netherite Ingot
<dl>
   <dd>
      <dl>
         <dd>
            <img width="300px" src="https://maxoduke.dev/assets/images/mods/portal-linking-compass/step1.png" alt="Craftin Recipe" />
         </dd>
      </dl>
   </dd>
</dl>  

Why an expensive recipe? This compass can be used as an alternative for vanilla lodestone, which I never intended. A lodestone requires a Netherite ingot to be crafted, so does this one.

### Step 2:
- Right-click a nether portal block with the compass.
<dl>
   <dd>
      <dl>
         <dd>
            <img width="300px" src="https://maxoduke.dev/assets/images/mods/portal-linking-compass/step2.jpg" alt="Right-click Portal with compass" />
         </dd>
      </dl>
   </dd>
</dl>

- The compass should now point to nether portal block.
- Go to the nether, the compass should point to the exact coordinates where you can build the portal to link them up perfectly.
- This also works vice-versa. That is, original portal in the nether âž” find coordinates in the overworld.
- If the portal that was right-click is destroyed, the compass will start spinning randomly.
